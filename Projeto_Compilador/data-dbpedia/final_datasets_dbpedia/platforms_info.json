Bei einigen wenigen Prozessoren wurde durch den Hersteller die Byte-Reihenfolge fest vorgegeben. Die meisten Hersteller von Systemen haben eine bevorzugte Byte-Reihenfolge und unterstützen nur diese. Einige wenige Systeme können umkonfiguriert werden. So unterstützen Systeme der RM-Serie von Siemens-Nixdorf Windows NT nur im Little Endian-Modus und das hauseigene UNIX Sinix nur im Big Endian-Modus. Weiterhin haben die meisten Prozessoren seit dem MIPS R4000 die Option im User Mode mit der entgegengesetzten Byte-Reihenfolge des Kernel- bzw. Supervisormodus zu arbeiten. Dieses Feature wird aber nur von der veröffentlichten UNIX-Variante RISC/os der früheren Firma MIPS Computer Systems verwendet da Softwareunterstützung sehr komplex und im Allgemeinen nicht als besonders nützlich betrachtet wird. Auch bei der Bereitstellung von Softwarepaketen oder für Cross-Compiler wird bei der Namensgebung ein mipsel für Little Endian Systeme und ein mips für Big Endian Systeme eingefügt. Da MIPS auch allgemein als die Bezeichnung der Architektur unabhängig von der Byte-Reihenfolge verwendet wird, wird manchmal MIPSeb als explizite Bezeichnung der big-endian Variante gewählt.", "MIPSel, pour MIPS endianness little[réf. nécessaire], désigne une architecture MIPS dont l'endianness est orienté little-endian.

El 10 de mayo de 2011 Microsoft compró Skype por 8,5 mil millones de dólares, programa que reemplazó finalmente a Windows Live Messenger. Inicialmente fue diseñado para sistemas Microsoft Windows, y después se lanzaría una versión disponible para Mac OS. A partir del año 2005, como parte de la creación de servicios web denominados Windows Live, se cambiaron de nombre muchos servicios y programas existentes de MSN, con lo que Messenger fue renombrado a \"Windows Live Messenger\" a partir de la versión 8.0. Bajo la denominación se engloban realmente tres programas diferentes: \n* MSN Messenger: es el cliente de mensajería instantánea y su nombre se utiliza para diferenciar todos los programas de mensajería de Microsoft. \n* Windows Messenger: viene incluido con Windows XP y se trata de un cliente de mensajería instantánea básico que no soporta muchas características de estos (avatares, imágenes, etcétera). Sin embargo, es capaz de conectarse al Servicio de comunicaciones y Exchange Instant Messaging usados por algunas empresas (por lo que se conoce como versión para empresas) y permite controlar una máquina de forma remota de forma similar al NetMeeting. Permite dos métodos de conexión: RVP (antiguo protocolo usado en las versiones anteriores a la 2003 de Exchange) y SIP/Simple. \n* MSN Web Messenger: versión web del cliente aparecida en agosto de 2004. Proporciona características similares al MSN Messenger en un navegador conectado a Internet. Su utilidad reside en que se puede conectar con una cuenta de correo desde un ordenador que no tenga el programa instalado. Los tres programas pueden usar el mismo protocolo por lo que muchas de sus características son similares. Para utilizar el servicio se requería una cuenta Microsoft Passport. Permite utilizar tanto texto como emoticonos, emoticones animados (GIF), escritura a mano (imagen), juegos o intercambio de archivos compartidos. También permitía conversaciones por voz, mediante una cámara digital y, si está instalado en el sistema Windows Messenger, es posible permitir el control remoto del ordenador a los contactos (restringiendo qué tareas pueden realizar) desde los clientes no web. Formaba parte de los servicios ofrecidos por el portal MSN que incluían correo electrónico con Hotmail o un motor de búsqueda. La más reciente versión de este programa se llama Windows Live Messenger y solo es compatible con el sistema operativo Windows XP y superior. Esta versión incluye la posibilidad de realizar llamadas a teléfonos fijos y móviles mediante los servicios de VoIP, además de contar ahora con la posibilidad de agregar contactos de Yahoo! Messenger. El servicio de mensajería instantánea dejó de funcionar el 15 de marzo de 2013 y fue absorbido por la plataforma Skype, líder global de servicios de VoIP y propiedad de Microsoft.", "MSN Messenger Windows eta Mac OS sistema eragileetan bat-bateko mezularitzan aritzeko ezaguna da.

O serviço nasceu a 22 de julho de 1999, anunciando-se como um serviço que permitia falar com uma pessoa através de conversas instantâneas pela internet. O programa permitia que um usuário da internet se relacionasse com outro que tivesse o mesmo programa em tempo real, podendo ter uma lista de amigos \"virtuais\" e acompanhar quando eles entram e saem da rede. Ele foi fundido com o Windows Messenger e originou o Windows Live Messenger. O pioneiro nesse tipo de aplicação foi o ICQ que em 1996 revolucionou o conceito de mensagens instantâneas online. Porém alguns anos depois o MSN conquistou cada vez mais adeptos em Portugal (embora na Europa o mensageiro mais utilizado continuasse a ser o ICQ) e se tornou líder do segmento no Brasil, onde foi consistentemente um dos programas mais baixados nos sites de downloads locais. O sucesso que o MSN Messenger teve pode ser explicado por ele ter sido integrado ao serviço de e-mail Hotmail, por ser incluso com o Windows XP e por ter uma intensa publicidade junto ao público jovem. Também teve como concorrente o Yahoo! Messenger, outro serviço igualmente integrado a e-mail. No dia 6 de novembro de 2012 foi feito o primeiro anúncio da descontinuidade do uso do programa, que foi, substituído em definitivo pelo Skype. No dia 9 de janeiro de 2013, a Microsoft comunicou o encerramento do serviço do programa no dia 15 de março, e que as contas dos usuário seriam migradas para o Skype, que pertence à companhia.

Название консоли отражает её главное отличие от предшественницы — цветное изображение вместо чёрно-белого WonderSwan. Кроме того, WonderSwan Color стал несколько больше и тяжелее (на 7 мм и 2 грамма), приобрёл ЗУПД в 64 Кб и более широкий жидкокристаллический дисплей. Система имеет совместимость со старыми играми, выпущенными для оригинальной WonderSwan. На протяжении достаточно долгого времени монополией на рынке карманных игровых систем обладала компания Nintendo, однако вышедшие на рубеже тысячелетий WonderSwan и позже WonderSwan Color оказались весьма популярными, что позволило Bandai захватить около 8 % японского игрового рынка. Успех прежде всего связан с небольшой стоимостью консоли — 6800 иен или 59 американских долларов. На западе консоль малоизвестна, так как ориентирована прежде всего на Японию, и практически все игры издавались на японском языке. Ещё одним толчком к популяризации WonderSwan Color послужило соглашение с компанией Square, по условиям которого на консоль должны были быть портированы ранние части серии Final Fantasy и некоторые другие игры. В итоге на ней появились Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy IV, The Final Fantasy Legend, а также такие известные игры как Front Mission и Romancing SaGa. Однако вскоре очень быстро начала набирать обороты более производительная конкурентная система Game Boy Advance, и разработчики Square, к тому времени наладившие партнёрские отношения с Nintendo, переключились на неё, заморозив многие запланированные проекты для WonderSwan Color.

Цель разработки HTML5 — улучшение уровня поддержки мультимедиа-технологий с одновременным сохранением обратной совместимости, удобочитаемости кода для человека и простоты анализа для парсеров. Во всемирной паутине долгое время использовались стандарты HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 и XHTML 1.1. Веб-страницы на практике оказывались свёрстаны с использованием смеси особенностей, представленных различными спецификациями, включая спецификации программных продуктов, например веб-браузеров, а также сложившихся общеупотребительных приёмов. HTML5 был создан как единый язык разметки, который мог бы сочетать синтаксические нормы HTML и XHTML. Он расширяет, улучшает и рационализирует разметку документов, а также добавляет единый API для сложных веб-приложений. В HTML5 реализовано множество новых синтаксических особенностей. Например, элементы <video></video>, <audio></audio> и <canvas></canvas>, а также возможность использования SVG и математических формул.

До складу робочої групи з HTML5 увійшли AOL, Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia, Opera та кілька сотень інших виробників. Існує деяка плутанина щодо версійності, оскільки існують дві незалежні групи розробників — WHATWG та W3C. WHATWG відмовились від принципу «версійності» на користь «вічної розробки» при прийнятті специфікації HTML. Таке рішення було спричинено намаганням пришвидшити втілення стандарту в життя, тобто розробникам веббраузерів не потрібно чекати допоки вийде офіційна затверджена версія специфікації (специфікація перейде в стан recomendation), вони можуть втілювати певні частини специфікації вже зараз. Тому за версією WHATWG існує тільки одна специфікація, яка постійно розвивається — HTML. Ці дві групи працювали в тандемі: WHATWG писав специфікації в режимі «живого стандарту», а W3C брав ці специфікації як «знімки», й впроваджував їх у чіткі версії своєї специфікації. W3C працював значно повільніше, бо повинен забезпечувати вимоги більшого спектра користувачів, а не тільки веббраузерів. 28 жовтня 2014 консорціум W3C оголосив про надання набору специфікацій HTML5 статусу рекомендованого стандарту. Цікаво, що у цьому вигляді специфікації HTML 5.0 були сформовані ще два роки до того, після чого робота була зосереджена на проведенні тестування та оцінки сумісності доступних реалізацій. На час стандартизації HTML5 вже давно став стандартом де-факто і активно використовується у вебзастосунках. Фактичне затвердження стандарту лише формально поставило крапку в просуванні HTML5 і підтвердило повсюдність і коректність його реалізації. Специфікації HTML5 не обмежуються тільки розміткою і включають в себе низку вебтехнологій, котрі у сукупності формують відкриту вебплатформу — програмне оточення для роботи крос-платформових застосунків, здатних взаємодіяти з обладнанням, і які підтримують засоби для роботи з відео, графікою і анімацією, що надає розширені мережеві можливості.", "HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language 5) est la dernière révision majeure du HTML (format de données conçu pour représenter les pages web). Cette version a été finalisée le 28 octobre 2014. HTML5 spécifie deux syntaxes d'un modèle abstrait défini en termes de DOM : HTML5 et XHTML5. Le langage comprend également : \n* une couche application avec de nombreuses API ", "HTML5 – język znaczników wykorzystywany do tworzenia i prezentowania stron internetowych www. Jest rozwinięciem języka HTML 4 i jego XML-owej odmiany (XHTML 1), opracowywane w ramach prac grupy roboczej WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) i W3C. Jest to konkurencyjna specyfikacja w stosunku do specyfikacji XHTML 2, której rozwój został porzucony 2 lipca 2009 roku – wsparcie wszystkich środowisk i producentów przeglądarek ukierunkowane jest na HTML 5. Nazwę można zapisywać jako HTML 5 – jako wersję lub HTML5 – jako nazwę. Prace nad specyfikacją zostały ukończone w 2014 roku – 28 października standard został oficjalnie wydany jako rekomendacja W3C. Dwa lata później – 1 listopada 2016 roku – została wydana wersja HTML 5.1 jako oficjalna rekomendacja W3C. Został wówczas także zaprezentowany szkic standardu HTML 5.2. Główna różnica pomiędzy HTML 5 a XHTML 2 polega na tym, że HTML 5 jest pisane z myślą o kompatybilności wstecznej, podczas gdy XHTML 2 zrywało z kompatybilnością. HTML5 poza dodaniem nowych elementów, usprawniających tworzenie serwisów i aplikacji internetowych, doprecyzowuje wiele niejasności w specyfikacji HTML 4, dotyczących przede wszystkim sposobu obsługi błędów. Niejasności co do sposobu, w jaki przeglądarki powinny obsługiwać błędy w kodzie HTML są jedną z podstawowych przyczyn, dla której wiele serwisów internetowych, napisanych z naruszeniem specyfikacji, w różnych przeglądarkach działa w inny sposób – w niektórych działając, w innych nie. Dzięki HTML-owi 5 obsługa błędów ma być ta sama we wszystkich przeglądarkach, czyli zły element będzie działać w każdej przeglądarce albo żadnej. HTML5 także stawia na semantykę. Element traci na znaczeniu na rzecz <main> <article> <aside> <footer> <nav> , a dodane zostają m.in. <code> <canvas> </canvas></code> <figure> <code> <details> <summary>. Element <code><span></span></code> ma być mniej używany na rzecz <code><mark> <output> <var> <u> <s></s></u></var></output></mark></code><u><s> (ostatnie dwa znaczniki były w HTML4 przestarzałe – <i>deprecated</i>).<p></p><p>Grupa pracująca nad HTML5 przyjęła inny sposób myślenia. Na przykład podkreślenie i przekreślenie podczas tworzenia HTML 4 uznano za elementy czysto prezentacyjne i przestarzałe – miały zostać usunięte w HTML5. Nawet kursywę i pogrubienie często próbowano zastąpić emfazą. W myśl tego nowe znaczniki liniowe nie powinny powstać. Gdyby sposób myślenia W3C się nie zmienił, nie powstałoby też kilka innych znaczników np. <code><progress></progress></code></p><p>HTML5 wysyłany jako XML to XHTML5.</p> <div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\" aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\"> <input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\"> <div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\"> <h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Spis treści</h2> <span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span> </div> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Niektóre_różnice_w_stosunku_do_HTML_4\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Niektóre różnice w stosunku do HTML 4</span></a> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Nowości_w_API\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nowości w API</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Nowe_metody_DOM\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nowe metody DOM</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Obsługa_błędów\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Obsługa błędów</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Historia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Historia</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Proces_normalizacji\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Proces normalizacji</span></a> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Rok_2008_–_Pierwszy_publiczny_projekt_roboczy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rok 2008 – Pierwszy publiczny projekt roboczy</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Rok_2012\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rok 2012</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Rok_2014\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rok 2014</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Nowe_typy_znaczników\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nowe typy znaczników</span></a> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Canvas\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Canvas</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Audio_i_wideo\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Audio i wideo</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Przykład\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Przykład</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Logo\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Logo</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Odbiór\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Odbiór</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Przypisy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Przypisy</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Linki_zewnętrzne\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Linki zewnętrzne</span></a></li> </ul> </div><h2><span id=\"Niekt.C3.B3re_r.C3.B3.C5.BCnice_w_stosunku_do_HTML_4\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Niektóre_różnice_w_stosunku_do_HTML_4\">Niektóre różnice w stosunku do HTML 4</span></h2> <ul> <li><b>Nowe tagi:</b> section, article, header, footer, nav, <a href=\"/wiki/Audio_i_Video_API\" title=\"Audio i Video API\">video</a>, audio, mark, progress, ...</li> <li><b>Nowe typy pól \"input\":</b> tel, search, url, email, datetime, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color.</li> <li><b>Nowe atrybuty elementów formularzy:</b> autofocus, required, autocomplete, min, max, multiple, pattern, step, ...</li> <li>W poprzednich wersjach HTML, tag <meta> nie miał atrybutu charset, który definiuje standardowe kodowanie znaków dla strony internetowej.

HTML5 sam nie może być jednak używany do animacji i interaktywności – musi być uzupełniony o <a href=\"/wiki/Kaskadowe_arkusze_styl%C3%B3w\" title=\"Kaskadowe arkusze stylów\">CSS3</a> oraz <a href=\"/wiki/JavaScript\" title=\"JavaScript\">JavaScript</a>.</p><p>Mimo że HTML5 jest dobrze znany wśród programistów od lat, stał się tematem mediów głównego nurtu od około kwietnia 2010 roku po tym, jak <a href=\"/wiki/Steve_Jobs\" title=\"Steve Jobs\">Steve Jobs</a>, ówczesny CEO firmy <a href=\"/wiki/Apple_Inc.\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">Apple</a> wystosował list publiczny zatytułowany „Rozważania na temat Flash’a”, w którym stwierdził, że „Flash nie jest już konieczny, aby obejrzeć film lub wyświetlać jakiekolwiek treści w internecie” oraz że „nowe, otwarte standardy stworzone w dobie <a href=\"/wiki/Urz%C4%85dzenie_mobilne\" title=\"Urządzenie mobilne\">urządzeń przenośnych</a>, takich jak HTML5, wygrają”. Wywołało to debatę w kręgach związanych z rozwojem sieci web. Niektórzy sugerowali, że deweloperzy muszą brać pod uwagę zmieniającą się obsługę przeglądarek, jak również inne różnice między HTML5 i Flash. Na początku listopada 2011 roku Adobe ogłosiło, że zaprzestanie rozwoju Flasha dla urządzeń mobilnych oraz skupi swoje wysiłki w rozwijaniu narzędzi wykorzystujących HTML5.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Proces_normalizacji\">Proces normalizacji</span></h2><p><a href=\"/wiki/Fundacja_Mozilla\" title=\"Fundacja Mozilla\">Fundacja Mozilla</a> i <a href=\"/wiki/Opera_Software\" title=\"Opera Software\">Opera Software</a> przedstawiła swoje stanowisko na warsztatach <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium\" title=\"World Wide Web Consortium\">W3C</a> w czerwcu 2004 roku, koncentrując się na rozwoju technologii, które są kompatybilne wstecz z istniejącymi przeglądarkami. Warsztat zakończył się głosowaniem: 8 za, 14 przeciw kontynuowaniu prac nad HTML. W tym samym miesiącu praca oparta na tym stanowisku została przeniesiona do nowo utworzonej grupy roboczej <a href=\"/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group\" title=\"Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group\">WHATWG</a>, a drugi projekt, Web 1.0, został również ogłoszony. Obie specyfikacje zostały później połączone w HTML5. Specyfikacja HTML5 została przyjęta jako punkt wyjścia do pracy z nowym HTML w 2007 roku.</p><h3><span id=\"Rok_2008_.E2.80.93_Pierwszy_publiczny_projekt_roboczy\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rok_2008_–_Pierwszy_publiczny_projekt_roboczy\">Rok 2008 – Pierwszy publiczny projekt roboczy</span></h3><p><a href=\"/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group\" title=\"Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group\">WHATWG</a> opublikował pierwszy projekt roboczy 22 stycznia 2008 roku.

Organizacja <a href=\"/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group\" title=\"Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group\">WHATWG</a> kontynuowała pracę z HTML5 udoskonalając ciągle funkcje.

1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe. The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market. The later 464plus and 6128plus, intended to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates, were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000. The CPC models' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU, complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM. Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device, either a compact cassette deck or 3-inch floppy disk drive. The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour, green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit's power supply. Additionally, a wide range of first and third-party hardware extensions such as external disk drives, printers, and memory extensions, was available. The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software. The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor, its high-resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users, which was reflected by a wide selection of application software. During its lifetime, the CPC series sold approximately three million units."], "debutDate": [""], "devs": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amstrad"], "families": [""]}, "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Android_(operating_system)": {"name": ["Android (operating system)"], "abstract": ["some with vendor-customized user interface and software suite, such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung, and HTC Sense.

Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for US$595 (equivalent to $1,670 in 2021). Preceded by the VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM. With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware. The C64 dominated the low-end computer market (except in the UK and Japan, lasting only about six months in Japan) for most of the later years of the 1980s. For a substantial period (1983–1986), the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year, outselling IBM PC compatibles, Apple computers, and the Atari 8-bit family of computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, \"When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years.\" In the UK market, the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum, but the C64 was still the second most popular computer in the UK after the ZX Spectrum. The Commodore 64 failed to make any impact in Japan. The Japanese market was dominated by Japanese computers, such as the NEC PC-8801, Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, and MSX.

Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy. Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu, the latter of which itself consists of many different distributions and modifications, including Lubuntu and Xubuntu.

Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.

This includes routers, automation controls, smart home devices, video game consoles, televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs), automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Toyota), and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule and the Perseverance rover).

It was originally developed as a proprietary software OS for personal digital assistants in 1998 by the Symbian Ltd. consortium. Symbian OS is a descendant of Psion's EPOC, and was released exclusively on ARM processors, although an unreleased x86 port existed. Symbian was used by many major mobile phone brands, like Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and above all by Nokia. It was also prevalent in Japan by brands including Fujitsu, Sharp and Mitsubishi. As a pioneer that established the smartphone industry, it was the most popular smartphone OS on a worldwide average until the end of 2010, at a time when smartphones were in limited use, when it was overtaken by iOS and Android. It was notably less popular in North America. The Symbian OS platform is formed of two components: one being the microkernel-based operating system with its associated libraries, and the other being the user interface (as middleware), which provides the graphical shell atop the OS. The most prominent user interface was the S60 (formerly Series 60) platform built by Nokia, first released in 2002 and powering most Nokia Symbian devices. UIQ was a competing user interface mostly used by Motorola and Sony Ericsson that focused on pen-based devices, rather than a traditional keyboard interface from S60. Another interface was the MOAP(S) platform from carrier NTT DoCoMo in the Japanese market. Applications of these different interfaces were not compatible with each other, despite each being built atop Symbian OS. Nokia became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd. in 2004 and purchased the entire company in 2008. The non-profit Symbian Foundation was then created to make a royalty-free successor to Symbian OS. Seeking to unify the platform, S60 became the Foundation's favoured interface and UIQ stopped development. The touchscreen-focused Symbian^1 (or S60 5th Edition) was created as a result in 2009. Symbian^2 (based on MOAP) was used by NTT DoCoMo, one of the members of the Foundation, for the Japanese market. Symbian^3 was released in 2010 as the successor to S60 5th Edition, by which time it became fully free software. The transition from a proprietary operating system to a free software project is believed to be one of the largest in history. Symbian^3 received the Anna and Belle updates in 2011. The Symbian Foundation disintegrated in late 2010 and Nokia took back control of the OS development. In February 2011, Nokia, by now the only remaining company still supporting Symbian outside Japan, announced that it would use Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone platform, while Symbian would be gradually wound down. Two months later, Nokia moved the OS to proprietary licensing, only collaborating with the Japanese OEMs and later outsourced Symbian development to Accenture. Although support was promised until 2016, including two major planned updates, by 2012 Nokia had mostly abandoned development and most Symbian developers had already left Accenture, and in January 2014 Nokia stopped accepting new or changed Symbian software from developers. The Nokia 808 PureView in 2012 was officially the last Symbian smartphone from Nokia.

It was included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was developed, and many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems. Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. The first version of the system software, which had no official name, was partially based on the Lisa OS, which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983. As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed. This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the \"System Folder\", a set of files that were loaded from disk. The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5. Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996, starting officially with version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh clone program. That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997. The last major release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999. Initial versions of the System Software ran one application at a time.

Continuity includes a \"Handoff\" feature that lets users start a task on one device and continue on another. Other changes included a new Spotlight Suggestions search results feature that provides more detailed results, Family Sharing, where a family can link together their accounts to share content, with one parent as the administrator with permission controls, an updated keyboard with QuickType, providing contextual predictive word suggestions and Extensibility, which allows for easier sharing of content between apps. Third-party developers got additional features to integrate their apps deeper into the operating system, including support for widgets in the Notification Center, and the ability to make keyboards that users can replace the default iOS keyboard with.

The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS (Multi Video System) coin-operated arcade machine. The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet, a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace, as well as saving money long-term. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork. A home console version was also made, called AES (Advanced Entertainment System). It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan (called Neo Geo Rental System), with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use – this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console. As of 2013 it was the most expensive home video game console ever released, costing US$649.99 (equivalent to $1,293 in 2021). The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility, allowing home users to play the games exactly as they were in the arcades. The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system.

Several successful video game series were released for the platform, such as Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting, Samurai Shodown, World Heroes, The King of Fighters and Metal Slug. The AES had a very niche market in Japan, though sales were very low in the U.S. due to its high price for both the hardware and software, but it has since gained a cult following and is now considered a collectable.

Released in September 1977, it popularized microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge—initially Combat and later Pac-Man. Atari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as codename Stella by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976. The Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first killer app was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco.

Amid competition from both new consoles and game developers, a number of poor decisions from Atari management affected the company and the industry as a whole. The most public was an extreme investment into licensed games for the 2600, including Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the system's biggest selling game, but the conversion's poor quality eroded consumer confidence in the console. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was critically panned and a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market.

Later, the term was primarily used in contrast to Apple's Macintosh computers. These \"clones\" duplicated almost all the significant features of the original IBM PC architectures. This was facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components, which were cheap, and by various manufacturers' ability to reverse-engineer the BIOS firmware using a \"clean room design\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer, the MPC 1600 by a clean-room reverse-engineered implementation of its BIOS. Other rival companies, Corona Data Systems, Eagle Computer, and the Handwell Corporation were threatened with legal action by IBM, who settled with them. Soon after in 1982, Compaq released the very successful Compaq Portable in 1982, also with a clean-room reverse-engineered BIOS, and also not challenged legally by IBM. Some early IBM PC compatibles used the same 8-bit computer bus as the original PC and XT models, but many soon adopted the 16-bit IBM AT bus. It was later re-named the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, after the Extended Industry Standard Architecture bus open standard for IBM PC compatibles was announced in September 1988 by a consortium of PC clone vendors, led by Compaq and called the Gang of Nine, as an alternative to IBM's proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) introduced in its PS/2 series. Soon after the industry adopted new bus standards in a similar, cooperative way: the VESA Local Bus (VLB), Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). Descendants of the x86 IBM PC compatibles, namely 64-bit computers based on \"x86-64/AMD64\" chips comprise the majority of desktop computers on the market as of 2021, with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows. Interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent. Many modern computers are unable to use old software or hardware that depends on portions of the IBM PC compatible architecture which are missing or do not have equivalents in modern computers. For example, computers which boot using Unified Extensible Firmware Interface-based firmware that lack a Compatibility Support Module, or CSM, required to emulate the old BIOS-based firmware interface, or have their CSMs disabled, cannot natively run MS-DOS since MS-DOS depends on a BIOS interface to boot. Only the Macintosh had kept significant market share without having compatibility with the IBM PC, although that changed with Intel Macs running Mac OS X, often dual-booting Windows with Boot Camp."], "debutDate": [""], "devs": [], "families": [""]}, "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microsoft_Silverlight": {"name": ["Microsoft Silverlight"], "abstract": ["Microsoft Silverlight is a discontinued application framework designed for writing and running rich web applications, similar to Adobe's runtime, Adobe Flash.

Reconsidering the design using modern electronics, they agreed the best solution was to build a complete computer with a terminal program in ROM.

The original version was created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1964. They wanted to enable students in non-scientific fields to use computers. At the time, nearly all computers required writing custom software, which only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn. In addition to the program language, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs simultaneously on remote terminals. This general model became very popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hewlett-Packard produced an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC. The emergence of microcomputers in the mid-1970s led to the development of multiple BASIC dialects, including Microsoft BASIC in 1975. Due to the tiny main memory available on these machines, often 4 KB, a variety of Tiny BASIC dialects were also created. BASIC was available for almost any system of the era, and became the de facto programming language for home computer systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These PCs almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default, often in the machine's firmware or sometimes on a ROM cartridge. BASIC declined in popularity in the 1990s, as more powerful microcomputers came to market and programming languages with advanced features (such as Pascal and C) became tenable on such computers.

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers.

By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature. They are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name. Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802. It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera. The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform. Low-level clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes. However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-. In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing. Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes. They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical. Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names. In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types. They may have the appearance of stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water. Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth. They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect. The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere.

The headset uses Fresnel lenses that are improved over those used in the company's previous headset, the Oculus Rift, and provide a field of view of about 101 degrees, which gives the Go a display fidelity of 12.67 pixels per degree. Input is provided with a wireless controller that functions much like a laser pointer. The headset and controller utilise non-positional 3-degrees-of-freedom tracking, making it capable of seated or static-standing activities but unsuitable for roomscale applications. The headset uses the Android mobile operating system and includes applications for watching both traditional and immersive video and other media from various sources, such as Facebook and the headset's internal storage, as well as streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu. Additional software is provided via the Oculus Store, a digital distribution platform created and maintained by Facebook Technologies. The headset was announced on October 11, 2017 and released on May 1, 2018 to generally positive reviews. By July 2019, the Go was estimated to have sold over two million units. On June 23, 2020, Facebook Technologies announced it would be ending the sales of the Oculus Go later that year and would not accept new Go apps or app updates into the Oculus Store after 4 December 2020. Some time after the headset was released, some users were noticing issues with the headset. The first issue was the Go's attachment to Gear VR. Oculus was successful in the VR industry before Facebook's acquirement, creating VR software for many VR devices, and that was one of the reasons that is caught Samsung's eye back in 2013 while arranging preparations for their VR development. However, Oculus never really created a VR experience so massive before. So with the Go's release, people were looking at a completely Gear VR based experience. This was an issue, because the Gear VR was not advanced enough and the store was deprived of apps, and the community was small. The Go was a stepping stone in Oculus' development. The failure of the Go due to the Gear VR caused Oculus to boost the store and interface to a different platform, and it was one of the main reasons that Samsung finally cut off the Gear VR. The Rift and Quest series ran on new, updated platforms that seemed to be more refreshed, and those devices seemed to take off better than the Go. The Quest 2 was one of the biggest hits in the VR industry."], "debutDate": [""], "devs": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xiaomi", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qualcomm", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oculus_VR"], "families": [""]}, "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oracle_Solaris": {"name": ["Oracle Solaris"], "abstract": ["Solaris is a proprietary Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems.

A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain. Watches were developed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called mechanical watches. In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as quartz crisis in Switzerland). Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities. In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. For mechanical watches, various extra features called \"complications,\" such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included. Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions. Furthermore, some modern watches (like smartwatches) even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time. Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic counterparts.

Expansion sets are used to extend CCGs, introducing new gameplay strategies and narrative lore through new cards in starter decks and booster packs, that may also lead to the development of theme decks. Successful CCGs typically have thousands of unique cards through multiple expansions. Magic: The Gathering initially launched with 300 unique cards and currently has more than 22,000 as of March 2020. The first CCG, Magic: The Gathering, was developed by Richard Garfield and published by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 and its initial runs rapidly sold out that year. By the end of 1994, Magic: The Gathering had sold over 1 billion cards, and during its most popular period, between 2008 and 2016, it had sold over 20 billion cards. Magic: The Gathering's early success led other game publishers to follow suit with their own CCGs in the following years. Other successful CCGs include Yu-Gi-Oh! which is estimated to have sold about 35 billion cards as of January 2021, and Pokémon which has sold over 43 billion cards as of March 2022.

The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life. Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their \"brick and mortar\" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online.

On August 28, 2009, it was released worldwide, and was made available for purchase from Apple's website and retail stores at the price of US$29 for a single-user license. As a result of the low price, initial sales of Snow Leopard were significantly higher than that of its predecessors whose price started at US$129. The release of Snow Leopard came nearly two years after the launch of Mac OS X Leopard, the second longest time span between successive Mac OS X releases (the time span between Tiger and Leopard was the longest). Unlike previous versions of Mac OS X, the goals of Snow Leopard were improved performance, greater efficiency and the reduction of its overall memory footprint. Apple famously marketed Snow Leopard as having \"zero new features\". Its name signified its goal to be a refinement of the previous OS X version, Leopard. Much of the software in Mac OS X was extensively rewritten for this release in order to take full advantage of modern Macintosh hardware and software technologies (64-bit, Cocoa, etc.). New programming frameworks, such as OpenCL, were created, allowing software developers to use graphics cards in their applications. It was also the first Mac OS release since System 7.1.1 to not support Macs using PowerPC processors, as Apple dropped support for them and focused on Intel-based products.

Snow Leopard was the last release of Mac OS X to support the 32-bit Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo CPUs.

The Alto is contained in a relatively small cabinet and uses a custom central processing unit (CPU) built from multiple SSI and MSI integrated circuits. Each machine cost tens of thousands of dollars despite its status as a personal computer. Only small numbers were built initially, but by the late 1970s, about 1,000 were in use at various Xerox laboratories, and about another 500 in several universities. Total production was about 2,000 systems. The Alto became well known in Silicon Valley and its GUI was increasingly seen as the future of computing. In 1979, Steve Jobs arranged a visit to Xerox PARC, during which Apple Computer personnel would receive demonstrations of Xerox technology in exchange for Xerox being able to purchase stock options in Apple. After two visits to see the Alto, Apple engineers used the concepts to introduce the Apple Lisa and Macintosh systems. Xerox eventually commercialized a heavily modified version of the Alto concepts as the Xerox Star, first introduced in 1981.

This contrasts with superscalar architectures, which depend on the processor to manage instruction dependencies at runtime. In all Itanium models, up to and including Tukwila, cores execute up to six instructions per clock cycle.
