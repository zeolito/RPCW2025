До складу робочої групи з HTML5 увійшли AOL, Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia, Opera та кілька сотень інших виробників. Існує деяка плутанина щодо версійності, оскільки існують дві незалежні групи розробників — WHATWG та W3C. WHATWG відмовились від принципу «версійності» на користь «вічної розробки» при прийнятті специфікації HTML. Таке рішення було спричинено намаганням пришвидшити втілення стандарту в життя, тобто розробникам веббраузерів не потрібно чекати допоки вийде офіційна затверджена версія специфікації (специфікація перейде в стан recomendation), вони можуть втілювати певні частини специфікації вже зараз. Тому за версією WHATWG існує тільки одна специфікація, яка постійно розвивається — HTML. Ці дві групи працювали в тандемі: WHATWG писав специфікації в режимі «живого стандарту», а W3C брав ці специфікації як «знімки», й впроваджував їх у чіткі версії своєї специфікації. W3C працював значно повільніше, бо повинен забезпечувати вимоги більшого спектра користувачів, а не тільки веббраузерів. 28 жовтня 2014 консорціум W3C оголосив про надання набору специфікацій HTML5 статусу рекомендованого стандарту. Цікаво, що у цьому вигляді специфікації HTML 5.0 були сформовані ще два роки до того, після чого робота була зосереджена на проведенні тестування та оцінки сумісності доступних реалізацій. На час стандартизації HTML5 вже давно став стандартом де-факто і активно використовується у вебзастосунках. Фактичне затвердження стандарту лише формально поставило крапку в просуванні HTML5 і підтвердило повсюдність і коректність його реалізації. Специфікації HTML5 не обмежуються тільки розміткою і включають в себе низку вебтехнологій, котрі у сукупності формують відкриту вебплатформу — програмне оточення для роботи крос-платформових застосунків, здатних взаємодіяти з обладнанням, і які підтримують засоби для роботи з відео, графікою і анімацією, що надає розширені мережеві можливості.", "إتش تي إم إل (بالإنجليزية: Hyper Text Markup Language)‏ وتختصر إلى HTML، وهي لغة تكوين صفحات مواقع الويب. و في الإصدار إتش تي إم إل 5 الجديد، يتم تقديم عدد من العناصر الجديدة والتي تسهل من فكرة تكوين الصفحات، حسب ما نقوم به يدوياً في XHTML 1.0 بالإضافة إلى تسهيل الأمور على محركات البحث في قراءة الصفحات ومعرفة ما هي أجزاء الصفحة الفعلية (الجزء العلوي (Header)، القائمة (Navigation) أو (nav)، الجزء الرئيسي (Main)، المحتوى (Sections) والجزء السفلي (Footer). كما توفر إتش تي إم إل 5 عدد من بيئات العمل المختلفة لتكوين الرسوميات والفيديو والعديد من المميزات التي تسهل الكثير مما يتم القيام به حالياً.", "HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language 5) est la dernière révision majeure du HTML (format de données conçu pour représenter les pages web).

Le langage comprend également : \n* une couche application avec de nombreuses API ", "HTML5 – język znaczników wykorzystywany do tworzenia i prezentowania stron internetowych www. Jest rozwinięciem języka HTML 4 i jego XML-owej odmiany (XHTML 1), opracowywane w ramach prac grupy roboczej WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) i W3C. Jest to konkurencyjna specyfikacja w stosunku do specyfikacji XHTML 2, której rozwój został porzucony 2 lipca 2009 roku – wsparcie wszystkich środowisk i producentów przeglądarek ukierunkowane jest na HTML 5. Nazwę można zapisywać jako HTML 5 – jako wersję lub HTML5 – jako nazwę. Prace nad specyfikacją zostały ukończone w 2014 roku – 28 października standard został oficjalnie wydany jako rekomendacja W3C. Dwa lata później – 1 listopada 2016 roku – została wydana wersja HTML 5.1 jako oficjalna rekomendacja W3C. Został wówczas także zaprezentowany szkic standardu HTML 5.2. Główna różnica pomiędzy HTML 5 a XHTML 2 polega na tym, że HTML 5 jest pisane z myślą o kompatybilności wstecznej, podczas gdy XHTML 2 zrywało z kompatybilnością. HTML5 poza dodaniem nowych elementów, usprawniających tworzenie serwisów i aplikacji internetowych, doprecyzowuje wiele niejasności w specyfikacji HTML 4, dotyczących przede wszystkim sposobu obsługi błędów. Niejasności co do sposobu, w jaki przeglądarki powinny obsługiwać błędy w kodzie HTML są jedną z podstawowych przyczyn, dla której wiele serwisów internetowych, napisanych z naruszeniem specyfikacji, w różnych przeglądarkach działa w inny sposób – w niektórych działając, w innych nie. Dzięki HTML-owi 5 obsługa błędów ma być ta sama we wszystkich przeglądarkach, czyli zły element będzie działać w każdej przeglądarce albo żadnej. HTML5 także stawia na semantykę. Element traci na znaczeniu na rzecz <main> <article> <aside> <footer> <nav> , a dodane zostają m.in. <code> <canvas> </canvas></code> <figure> <code> <details> <summary>. Element <code><span></span></code> ma być mniej używany na rzecz <code><mark> <output> <var> <u> <s></s></u></var></output></mark></code><u><s> (ostatnie dwa znaczniki były w HTML4 przestarzałe – <i>deprecated</i>).<p></p><p>Grupa pracująca nad HTML5 przyjęła inny sposób myślenia. Na przykład podkreślenie i przekreślenie podczas tworzenia HTML 4 uznano za elementy czysto prezentacyjne i przestarzałe – miały zostać usunięte w HTML5. Nawet kursywę i pogrubienie często próbowano zastąpić emfazą. W myśl tego nowe znaczniki liniowe nie powinny powstać. Gdyby sposób myślenia W3C się nie zmienił, nie powstałoby też kilka innych znaczników np. <code><progress></progress></code></p><p>HTML5 wysyłany jako XML to XHTML5.</p> <div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\" aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\"> <input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\"> <div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\"> <h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Spis treści</h2> <span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span> </div> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Niektóre_różnice_w_stosunku_do_HTML_4\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Niektóre różnice w stosunku do HTML 4</span></a> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Nowości_w_API\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nowości w API</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Nowe_metody_DOM\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nowe metody DOM</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Obsługa_błędów\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Obsługa błędów</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Historia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Historia</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Proces_normalizacji\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Proces normalizacji</span></a> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Rok_2008_–_Pierwszy_publiczny_projekt_roboczy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rok 2008 – Pierwszy publiczny projekt roboczy</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Rok_2012\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rok 2012</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Rok_2014\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rok 2014</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Nowe_typy_znaczników\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nowe typy znaczników</span></a> <ul> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Canvas\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Canvas</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Audio_i_wideo\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Audio i wideo</span></a></li> </ul></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Przykład\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Przykład</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Logo\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Logo</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Odbiór\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Odbiór</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Przypisy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Przypisy</span></a></li> <li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Linki_zewnętrzne\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Linki zewnętrzne</span></a></li> </ul> </div><h2><span id=\"Niekt.C3.B3re_r.C3.B3.C5.BCnice_w_stosunku_do_HTML_4\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Niektóre_różnice_w_stosunku_do_HTML_4\">Niektóre różnice w stosunku do HTML 4</span></h2> <ul> <li><b>Nowe tagi:</b> section, article, header, footer, nav, <a href=\"/wiki/Audio_i_Video_API\" title=\"Audio i Video API\">video</a>, audio, mark, progress, ...</li> <li><b>Nowe typy pól \"input\":</b> tel, search, url, email, datetime, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color.</li> <li><b>Nowe atrybuty elementów formularzy:</b> autofocus, required, autocomplete, min, max, multiple, pattern, step, ...</li> <li>W poprzednich wersjach HTML, tag <meta> nie miał atrybutu charset, który definiuje standardowe kodowanie znaków dla strony internetowej.

Wywołało to debatę w kręgach związanych z rozwojem sieci web. Niektórzy sugerowali, że deweloperzy muszą brać pod uwagę zmieniającą się obsługę przeglądarek, jak również inne różnice między HTML5 i Flash. Na początku listopada 2011 roku Adobe ogłosiło, że zaprzestanie rozwoju Flasha dla urządzeń mobilnych oraz skupi swoje wysiłki w rozwijaniu narzędzi wykorzystujących HTML5.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Proces_normalizacji\">Proces normalizacji</span></h2><p><a href=\"/wiki/Fundacja_Mozilla\" title=\"Fundacja Mozilla\">Fundacja Mozilla</a> i <a href=\"/wiki/Opera_Software\" title=\"Opera Software\">Opera Software</a> przedstawiła swoje stanowisko na warsztatach <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium\" title=\"World Wide Web Consortium\">W3C</a> w czerwcu 2004 roku, koncentrując się na rozwoju technologii, które są kompatybilne wstecz z istniejącymi przeglądarkami.

Fatshark have used the engine in a number of their games. Games built with the engine include Escape Dead Island, Hamilton's Great Adventure, Krater, Gauntlet, Helldivers, Magicka: Wizard Wars, Magicka 2, The Showdown Effect, War of the Vikings, War of the Roses, Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide and Warhammer: Vermintide 2.

Originally created by FutureWave under the name FutureSplash Player, it was renamed to Macromedia Flash Player after Macromedia acquired FutureWave in 1996. It was then developed and distributed by Adobe Systems as Flash Player after Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. It is currently developed and distributed by Zhongcheng for users in China, and by Harman International for enterprise users outside of China, in collaboration with Adobe. Flash Player runs SWF files that can be created by Adobe Flash Professional, Adobe Flash Builder or by third-party tools such as FlashDevelop. Flash Player supports vector graphics, 3D graphics, embedded audio, video and raster graphics, and a scripting language called ActionScript, which is based on ECMAScript (similar to JavaScript) and supports object-oriented code. Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge Legacy, in Windows 8 and later, along with Google Chrome on all versions of Windows, came bundled with a sandboxed Adobe Flash plug-in. Flash Player once had a large user base, and was a common format for web games, animations, and graphical user interface (GUI) elements embedded in web pages. Adobe stated in 2013 that more than 400 million out of over 1 billion connected desktops updated to new versions of Flash Player within six weeks of release. However, Flash Player became increasingly criticized for its performance, consumption of battery on mobile devices, the number of security vulnerabilities that had been discovered in the software, and its closed platform nature. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was highly critical of Flash Player, having published an open letter detailing Apple's reasoning for not supporting Flash on its iOS device family. Its usage also waned because of modern web standards that allow some of Flash's use cases to be fulfilled without third-party plugins. This led to the eventual deprecation of the platform by Adobe. Flash Player was officially discontinued on 31 December 2020, and its download page was removed two days later. Since 12 January 2021, Flash Player (original global variants) versions newer than 32.0.0.371, released in May 2020, refuse to play Flash content and instead display a static warning message.

A press release that was enclosed with the second trailer eventually confirmed that Grand Theft Auto IV is the first of Rockstar's games to feature Euphoria. Red Dead Redemption is their second game to use this engine.

O3D is currently in Google's incubation lab, and was originally built as a web browser plugin. Since 2010, O3D is a JavaScript library implemented on top of WebGL. O3D is viewed as bridging the gap between desktop-based 3D accelerated graphics applications and HTML-based web browsers. Proponents assert that creating a full-featured 3D graphics engine that can be downloaded and run through web browsers may eliminate the need to install large applications on a local desktop computer. This allows O3D to maximize reusability amongst application resources, while providing a robust interface to the client's CPU and GPU using JavaScript. Originally, O3D used a plug-in based architecture which allowed 3rd party developers to integrate custom functionality, such as pre- and post-render effects, particle systems, and physics engines. Because the plugin was written in C, it communicated directly with hardware", "thus, the speed of scene rendering was largely dependent on the GPU of the computer rendering it. Now, much of this same functionality is built into WebGL. The main advantage O3D has over alternative desktop or console based 3D rendering engines is that O3D may load, render, and transform models and their respective textures dynamically, using AJAX and/or COMET in real time. Traditional compilation of source code, application resources, and object libraries are no longer necessary, since all of these are loaded in real time. These remote resources may be designed, developed, and maintained outside the core rendering or viewing application within a typical object-oriented MVC application. This makes developing rich 3D application easier because they do not need to be recompiled per resource changes, allowing for a more robust and distributive approach when designing 3D applications.

In 2020, the series returned under Activision with a remake of the original two games in the series, with development handled by Vicarious Visions. The series has spawned a total of 20 games.

The player traverses each of the game's levels to find an elevator to the next level or kill a final boss, fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives and a variety of guns. Wolfenstein 3D was the second major independent release by id Software, after the Commander Keen series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer John Carmack experimented with making a fast 3D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane, producing Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly Keen to a more violent theme, programmer John Romero suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter Castle Wolfenstein as a fast-paced action game. He and designer Tom Hall designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time.

Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but constants, comments, assembler directives, symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros are generally also supported. The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C.. Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an . The term \"assembler\" is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill in their 1951 book The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer, who, however, used the term to mean \"a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program\". The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time. Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture. Sometimes there is more than one assembler for the same architecture, and sometimes an assembler is specific to an operating system or to particular operating systems. Most assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls, and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system, as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor, upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest. In contrast to assembly languages, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling, much more complicated tasks than assembling. In the first decades of computing, it was commonplace for both systems programming and application programming to take place entirely in assembly language. While still irreplaceable for some purposes, the majority of programming is now conducted in higher-level interpreted and compiled languages. In \"No Silver Bullet\", Fred Brooks summarised the effects of the switch away from assembly language programming: \"Surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity, reliability, and simplicity has been the progressive use of high-level languages for programming. Most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity, and with concomitant gains in reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility.\" Today, it is typical to use small amounts of assembly language code within larger systems implemented in a higher-level language, for performance reasons or to interact directly with hardware in ways unsupported by the higher-level language.

Flare3D runs on current web browsers utilizing the Adobe Flash Player, and uses Stage3D for GPU-accelerated rendering. Flare3D has not been under active development since late 2014. Flare3D has been used to develop popular browser-based video games such as FarmVille 2 and CityVille 2. Flare3D is one of the first frameworks to make GPU-accelerated 3D applications practical for web browsers, and is similar in purpose and design to Away3D. Flare3D has been used to create 3D models in online applications, such as Space Designer 3D. The Flare3D platform consists of a 3D world editor, a runtime engine, and a collection of plug-ins for various applications. The 3D editor may be used to lay out 3D objects, and to generate compressed Flare3D binary packages of 3D models. Such 3D models and animations may be imported from third-party programs such as Autodesk 3ds Max, or Autodesk Maya, or other mesh-based 3D modeller.

This enables characters to move while maintaining the original illustration at low-cost. It can be considered as the balance of cost and effect of an animation. Live2D characters consist of layered parts. Parts are separately moved to show the whole animation and expression of the character, such as tilting head.

The number of layers depends on how you wish the Live2D character present movements. The layers are rigged to a skeleton to form a whole animated character in real-time.

Such computers were referred to as PC clones, IBM clones or IBM PC clones. The term \"IBM PC compatible\" is now a historical description only, since IBM no longer sells personal computers after it sold its personal computer division in 2005 to Chinese technology company Lenovo. The designation \"PC\", as used in much of personal computer history, has not meant \"personal computer\" generally, but rather an x86 computer capable of running the same software that a contemporary IBM PC could. The term was initially in contrast to the variety of home computer systems available in the early 1980s, such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and Commodore 64. Later, the term was primarily used in contrast to Apple's Macintosh computers. These \"clones\" duplicated almost all the significant features of the original IBM PC architectures. This was facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components, which were cheap, and by various manufacturers' ability to reverse-engineer the BIOS firmware using a \"clean room design\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer, the MPC 1600 by a clean-room reverse-engineered implementation of its BIOS. Other rival companies, Corona Data Systems, Eagle Computer, and the Handwell Corporation were threatened with legal action by IBM, who settled with them. Soon after in 1982, Compaq released the very successful Compaq Portable in 1982, also with a clean-room reverse-engineered BIOS, and also not challenged legally by IBM. Some early IBM PC compatibles used the same 8-bit computer bus as the original PC and XT models, but many soon adopted the 16-bit IBM AT bus. It was later re-named the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, after the Extended Industry Standard Architecture bus open standard for IBM PC compatibles was announced in September 1988 by a consortium of PC clone vendors, led by Compaq and called the Gang of Nine, as an alternative to IBM's proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) introduced in its PS/2 series. Soon after the industry adopted new bus standards in a similar, cooperative way: the VESA Local Bus (VLB), Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). Descendants of the x86 IBM PC compatibles, namely 64-bit computers based on \"x86-64/AMD64\" chips comprise the majority of desktop computers on the market as of 2021, with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows. Interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent. Many modern computers are unable to use old software or hardware that depends on portions of the IBM PC compatible architecture which are missing or do not have equivalents in modern computers. For example, computers which boot using Unified Extensible Firmware Interface-based firmware that lack a Compatibility Support Module, or CSM, required to emulate the old BIOS-based firmware interface, or have their CSMs disabled, cannot natively run MS-DOS since MS-DOS depends on a BIOS interface to boot.

The Dreamcast was developed by an internal Sega team led by Hideki Sato. In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Saturn, the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with \"off-the-shelf\" components, including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU. Sega used the GD-ROM media format to avoid the expenses of DVD-ROM technology and a custom version of the Windows CE operating system to make porting PC games easy. The Dreamcast was the first console to include a built-in modular modem for internet access and online play. Though released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast had a successful US launch backed by a large marketing campaign. However, interest steadily declined as Sony built anticipation for the PlayStation 2. Dreamcast sales did not meet Sega's expectations after several price cuts, and the company suffered significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrew from the console business, and restructured itself as a third-party developer. 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide.

This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster. A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users. Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries. Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information.

The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.4 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras. Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. After European powers initiated prolonged periods of monarchial rule by a foreign family, the country fell to a military junta in 1967. Subsequently, the junta collapsed in 1974 and Greece returned to democratic governance, which has continued to this day. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Greece is a unitary parliamentary republic, and a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy, and a high quality of life, ranking 32nd in the Human Development Index. Its economy is among the largest in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO, the OECD, the WTO, and the OSCE.

The initial specified clock rate or frequency limit was 2 MHz, with common instructions using 4, 5, 7, 10, or 11 cycles. As a result, the processor is able to execute several hundred thousand instructions per second. Two faster variants, the 8080A-1 (sometimes referred to as the 8080B) and 8080A-2, became available later with clock frequency limits of 3.125 MHz and 2.63 MHz respectively.The 8080 needs two support chips to function in most applications: the i8224 clock generator/driver and the i8228 bus controller. It is implemented in N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic (NMOS) using non-saturated enhancement mode transistors as loads thus demanding a +12 V and a −5 V voltage in addition to the main transistor–transistor logic (TTL) compatible +5 V. Although earlier microprocessors were commonly used in mass-produced devices such as calculators, cash registers, computer terminals, industrial robots, and other applications, the 8080 saw greater success in a wider set of applications, and is largely credited with starting the microcomputer industry.
